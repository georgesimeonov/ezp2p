I need to create a lightweight purchase to pay system. Let's begin by describing the process it's supposed to automate.

The first step is to create a purchase order request (POR) where the user (REQUESTER) specifies the items they need to purchase. 
The purchase order request should include the items which need to be purchased and the quantites for each item.

The next step is to send the POR to a user (APPROVER) who has the authority to approve or reject it.

If the purchase order request (POR) is approved, the next step is creating the purchase order (PO).
The purchase order should include the items which need to be purchased, the quantities for each item, and the supplier from which the items will be purchased.

A POR might include items from multiple suppliers, so it should be split into multiple POs, one for each supplier.

This is a document that lists the items that need to be purchased, along with the quantity and price of each item.
The purchase order is then sent to the supplier, who will fulfill the order and send an invoice.
