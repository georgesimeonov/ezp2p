I'm developing this project in my personal free time and SOMETIMES during company time.
Both me and the company have a shared interest in this.
I'll increase my core competencies in business process automation as well as my skils as a developer from both of which the company greatly benefits
On the other hand, I'll get my Master's Degree from UTP.
I'll present my work to the company internally and will keep it private up until I'm employed by it.
I will volunteer to implement any idea coming from the project into DocuWare's system if management likes it.
I reserve the right to make the GitHub repository public if I leave the company at some point in order to improve my job prospects
I will use SOME companies resources occasionally (Visual Studio, company laptop, company internet), but will NOT use any production code at any point whatsoever!
